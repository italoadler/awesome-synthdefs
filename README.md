# awesome-synthdefs

This is a repository of SynthDefs for the SuperCollider language, started with the hope of 'synthesizing' (forgive me) some community knowledge on how to write SynthDefs and make some good sounds.

I've had a think of how to structure this and the best format I've thought of so far is to do the following:

1. Make a folder with your name
2. Inside that folder, put a readme with any info/links about the SynthDefs you've contributed, and any other information you want to include.
3. Make a subfolder for `SynthDefs` and a subfolder for `Examples`
4. Put your `SynthDefs` in the `SynthDefs` folder, preferably commented with some information about what they are for, and what variables do. Try and package the SynthDefs as executable `.scd` files so that they can be pulled into other projects easily, or can be referenced easily within your `Examples`.
5. If you can, put some examples of how you use the SynthDefs in the example folder - to give an idea of how to use it, and any sweet spots in the settings
6. Make whatever other folders you think you need to functionally package the SynthDef (samples/tunings/data/etc)
7. Open a pull request and get your SynthDefs in here. The more the merrier.

I've made an `Example_user` folder that demonstrates this with one SynthDef and examples

This format is pretty flexible, so don't feel bound to it. Equally don't feel bound to just adding SynthDefs, add bits of synthesis, cool functions, one-liners etc etc. Really the goal is to build a library of practices that SuperCollider folks are using, with the hope that we can learn from each other.
